# Buttplug NFT Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the _Buttplug_ NFT collection. Despite the playful name, these aren't what you might think! They're truly unique and visually captivating oscilloscopes, crafted with passion and ingenuity by the WebtrES community.
This is also the first NFT Collection written in Huff and deplyed on mainnet. We have no certainties about this fact, but neither do we have doubts.

## What is WebtrES?

WebtrES is a collective of talented hackers, primarily Spanish-speaking, dedicated to innovative and exciting projects in the blockchain space. With our diverse set of skills, we've come together to bring the _Buttplug_ collection to life!

## Contract Details

- **Name**: `Huffplug.huff`
- **Language**: The contract is written in Huff, using the `Huffmate` libraries. For those unfamiliar with Huff, it's a low-level language that gives us the power and flexibility to ensure optimal performance.

## Contract address

- [Huffplug](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000420538cd5abfbc7db219b6a1d125f5892ab0#code)

## Minting Buttplugs

There are two unique methods for minting a Buttplug:

1. **Merkle Tree Method**: Only those whose Ethereum addresses are listed on our Merkle tree can mint Buttplugs. To become eligible, a user must have at least two POAPs. So if you're an active participant in the Ethereum community, you might just be on our list! [You could find more details here](./merkletree-builder/README.md)

2. **Nonce Challenge Method**: Inspired by the classic MoonCats Rescue mechanism, users can also mint by finding a nonce that, when hashed, produces a digest with a certain number of leading zeros. This method ensures fairness and accessibility to all, while also introducing an element of skill and challenge. As time progresses, the difficulty adjusts based on the number of days since the contract deployment in relation to the number of Buttplugs that have been minted.

## Difficulty Adjustment

To keep the minting process challenging and exciting, the difficulty will adjust over time. As more days pass since the contract deployment and as more Buttplugs are minted, the nonce challenge will adjust accordingly, ensuring a balanced minting rate.

## Exclusive Rights

To maintain the integrity and uniqueness of our project, only our primary contract, _ButtplugPlugger_, has the authority to mint Buttplugs. This ensures that each piece in this collection is authentic and truly valuable.
